# **Netlist Generator Algorithm Test**

The **Netlist Generator Algorithm Test** folder provides tools and resources to test and compare different methods for generating netlists from the model's output. It includes the necessary scripts, test images, and reference netlists to evaluate the accuracy of the netlist generation methods.

## **Folder Structure**

### **1. Test Images**
- A folder containing the test images for evaluating the netlist generation methods.
- These images are used as input for the methods to generate netlists.

### **2. Correct Netlist Results**
- A folder containing reference netlist files in `.txt` format.
- These files represent the **ground truth** netlists for the images in the `Test Images` folder.
- Used for comparison with the generated netlists from the methods.

### **3. Methods folders**
- Folders containing the different approaches for generating netlists.
- **Contents**:
  - **`Test Outputs for Debugging`**:
    - A folder with additional debugging information specific to this method.
    - Includes intermediary outputs and debugging data.
  - **`Test Results`**:
    - A folder with `.txt` files of the netlists generated by Method 1.
    - These files are compared with the correct netlists in the `Correct Netlist Results` folder.
  - **`Method.ipynb`**:
    - A Jupyter Notebook containing the implementation of the Method for generating netlists.
    - Processes the images in the `Test Images` folder and outputs netlists to the `Test Results` folder.
  
### **4. `Methods Results Comparator.ipynb`**
- A Jupyter Notebook for comparing the results of different netlist generation methods.
- **Functionality**:
  - Compares the netlists generated by the various methods against the correct netlists in the `Correct Netlist Results` folder.
  - Produces evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of each method.

## **How to Use**

1. **Generate Netlists**:
   - Open a `Method.ipynb` notebook in the `Method` folder.
   - Run the notebook to process the images in the `Test Images` folder and generate netlists in the `Test Results` folder.

2. **Compare Results**:
   - Open the `Methods Results Comparator.ipynb` notebook.
   - Use the notebook to compare the netlists in the `Test Results` folder against the correct netlists in the `Correct Netlist Results` folder or against another method.
   - View the evaluation metrics to assess the accuracy of the Methods.

## **Expected Outputs**

- **Generated Netlists**:
  - Text files containing the generated netlists are saved in the `Test Results` folder within the `Method` folder.
- **Comparison Results**:
  - Metrics comparing the generated netlists with the correct netlists are produced by the `Methods Results Comparator.ipynb` notebook.
